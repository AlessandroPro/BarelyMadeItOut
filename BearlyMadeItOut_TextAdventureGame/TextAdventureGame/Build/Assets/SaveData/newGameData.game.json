I miss the wild air, the hills, the open river streams...and big trees in the forest to rub my brown, furry back on. I think it's time I finally break out of here, but the only way out is through the main entrance, which I believe is locked at night. Hmmm...OH LOOK, my feeder left the gate unlocked! I wish I could get out of here right now, but that main entrance gate won't be open until morning, when guests start pouring in. Then there will be too many people around for me to escape stealthily in the morning...unless...I can find a disguise! Maybe I should look around the zoo tonight and find some items to wear so I could hide my bearish looks. Then I'll come back here when I have all I need, GO TO SLEEP, and walk on outta here in the morning, looking just like one of those disgusting humans. I'll probably need stuff to cover the top of my head, my front paws, my back paws, my eyes, and something to cover most of my body...alright...I should start looking before night ends and not waste anymore time...",
